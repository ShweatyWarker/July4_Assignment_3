# ðŸ“– About MapleSyrupAPI

MapleSyrupAPI is a pretend RESTful API built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **local JSON data**, intended to help beginners practice:

- Making API requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Understanding how endpoints work
- Playing with mock data in a realistic format
- Collaborating via GitHub and learning open source workflow

### ðŸ§ª What Can You Do With It?

- Use it in frontend practice projects (React, Vue, etc.)
- Build a syrup browser or random syrup generator
- Learn GitHub collaboration and pull requests
- Add your own syrup entries or new endpoints

### ðŸ“Š Sample API Features

- `/api/syrups`: Get all syrup entries  
- `/api/syrups/:id`: Get syrup by ID  
- `/api/syrups/random`: Get a random syrup (future idea!)  
- Supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

### ðŸ’¡ Why Maple Syrup?

Because weâ€™re Canadian â€” and what better way to learn APIs than with something that pours as smooth as Express.js?
