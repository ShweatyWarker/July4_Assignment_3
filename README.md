Maple Syrup: The Staple Of Canadian Breakfast
# 🍁 MapleSyrupAPI

A beginner-friendly, proudly Canadian open-source project that lets you explore the **sweet world of maple syrup** through a fake RESTful API! This project is designed for developers who want to learn how APIs work, practice contributing to open source, or just love maple syrup as much as we do.

- 🌲 Province of Origin (Quebec, Ontario, etc.)
- 🍽️ Best Pairings (pancakes, waffles, bacon, etc.)
- 📊 Sugar Content
- 💬 Fun Facts

  Example response:

{
  "id": 3,
  "name": "L'Érable Supreme",
  "grade": "Amber",
  "origin": "Quebec",
  "pairings": ["Pancakes", "Sausage", "Cocktails"],
  "sugar_content": "67%",
  "fun_fact": "Quebec produces over 70% of the world’s maple syrup!"
}
